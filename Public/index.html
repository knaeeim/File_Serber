        write a command “cd ‘folder Name’”

        To add any Kind of file in Working directory and folder need to write a command “touch “Name of the folder” and
        press enter.

        To return back to the folder or working directory we need to write a command “ cd ../” Press enter.

        If we want to send out Git from Github to local machine the then we need to clone the git by writing the comment
        “git clone “url of git folder from git hub”
